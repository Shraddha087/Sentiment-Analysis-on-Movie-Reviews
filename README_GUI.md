# Quick GUI

Run the GUI app which loads `model/sentiment_model.pkl` and lets you enter reviews to predict.

Run with:

```powershell
c:; cd 'C:\Users\Dell\Desktop\Sentiment Analysis Of Movie Reviews'; & 'c:\Python314\python.exe' gui_app.py
```

If your model is in a different path, use the "Browse..." button to select the `.pkl` file.

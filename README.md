# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Movie-Reviews
This project builds a complete Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to classify the sentiment of movie reviews as positive or negative. It includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, deployment, and a real-time prediction interface.

🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze movie reviews and determine whether the expressed sentiment is positive or negative.
The pipeline uses TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression, optimized using GridSearchCV to reduce misclassification errors.

The final model offers:

✔ 15% reduction in misclassification after tuning
✔ Real-time inference under 2 seconds
✔ Clean, modular, and production-ready architecture
✔ Easy-to-run scripts for training and prediction
